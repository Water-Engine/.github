# The Water Engine

Welcome to the Water Engine! We are a small team of developers building a powerful yet easy-to-use suite of chess-related tools/apps.

## Mission
Our goal is to facilitate learning through doing, and to have fun and find success along the way. Iteration is paramount, failure is expected, recovery should be graceful.

### Philosophy
- Experiment freely: if you're on the fence about an implementation, just go for it!
- Keep it simple: focus on small, incremental improvements.
- Collaborate openly: share knowledge, review code, and support each other.

# Getting Started with the Water Engine

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Water-Engine/water.git
cd water
zig build run --release
```

This will build and run the engine with a default configuration.
